For some long time I have been worried about the Abraham-Minkowski
controversy regarding the correct expression for the momentum density
for the electromagnetic field within a material. I started writing
about it about five years ago, forgot about it and recently retaken
it. My guess is that the controversy will be definitively solved by
accounting by the mechanical momentum exchanged between the field and
the material. I also found that a similar controversy might appear for
other kind of waves such as acoustical waves. One
attempt to solve the controversy by accounting for all forces failed
and I have been unable to find why it failed. Thus I post here a
[very incomplete preprint](../../../../assets/pdf/abraham20210116.pdf). Maybe someone may point out what I'm missing.
