Together with Merlyn Jaqueline Ju√°rez we made a [dockerfile](https://github.com/wlmb/PDL-Dockerfile) to build a
[docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/wlmb/perldatalanguage) containing a working installation of the [Perl Data Language](http://pdl.perl.org/) (PDL), and
another [dockerfile](https://github.com/wlmb/Photonic-Dockerfile) for building a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/wlmb/photonic) with an installation of
the [Photonic](https://github.com/wlmb/Photonic) package to make photonic and metamaterials calculations
with `perl` and `PDL`.
