Today my article _Analytical Theory of Second Harmonic Generation from a
    Nanoparticle with a Non-Centrosymmetric Geometry_,
by Raksha Singla and W. Luis Moch√°n,
[Physical Review B **99**, 125418
(2019)](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.125418)
[doi:10.1103/PhysRevB.99.125418](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.125418)
was published. We showed that a centrosymmetric system may indeed
generate light at the second harmonic quite efficiently if its
geometry is not centrosymmetric.
