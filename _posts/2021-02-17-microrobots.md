I just heard a webinar organized by Physics Today by Marc Miskin from
U Penn on micron sized robots. The talk was very good and
interesting. The abstract was

> Nature routinely makes smart, complex, yet microscopically tiny machines: cells.
> But how can humans do it? And can we do it in a way that is easy to design and
> understand? This talk is about how to build a microscopic robot, one too small
> to see with the naked eye. We will discuss a platform that merges silicon-based
> microelectronics with a new technology for motion control to build simple,
> legged robots smaller than a hair's width. Every step in this process can be
> performed massively in parallel, allowing us to produce over one million robots
> per 4-inch wafer. Combined, we will show how these results point to a future of
> intelligent, highly functional robots that are ten times smaller than the period
> at the end of this sentence.

There is a paper in Nature: [Electronically integrated, mass-manufactured microscopic robots](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2626-9).
