# Task 1: Represent Integer

    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    You are given a positive integer $N and a digit $D.

    Write a script to check if $N can be represented as a sum of
    positive integers having $D at least once. If check passes
    print 1 otherwise 0.

    Example
    Input: $N = 25, $D = 7
    Output: 0 as there are 2 numbers between 1 and 25 having the
            digit 7 i.e. 7 and 17. If we add up both we don't get 25.

    Input: $N = 24, $D = 7
    Output: 1

This may be considered a combinatorial problem that could be solved by
examining all subsets of the set of numbers that has at least one digit
`$D` and testing if their sum gives $N. The subsets may be numbered by
a binary number where each bit corresponds to a given candidate number
which is included if the bit is 1 or excluded if the bit is 0. I make
an iterator that produces all the subsets of a given set. Simple
but slow.

    # Perl weekly challenge 113
    # Task 1: Represent integer. Slow, exhaustive
    #
    # See https://wlmb.github.io/2021/05/22/PWC113/#task-1-represent-integer
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use v5.12;
    use List::Util qw(sum0);
    use POSIX qw(floor);

    my ($N, $D)=@ARGV; #get arguments from command line.
        die "Usage: ./ch-1a.pl positive-integer digit"
        unless defined $N and defined $D and $N>=0
               and $D=~m/^\d$/ and $N==floor $N;
    my $next=subsets(grep {m/$D/} (1..$N));
    while(my @subset=$next->()){
        say("Inputs: N=$N D=$D: Output: 1 as $N=",
             join "+", @subset), exit if sum0(@subset)==$N;
    }
    say "Inputs: N=$N D=$D: Output: 0";

    sub subsets {
        my @set=@_;
        my $subset_counter=2**@set; # Total number of subsets
        my $done=0;
        sub {
    	return () if $done;
    	--$subset_counter;
    	$done=1, return () unless $subset_counter;
    	my @subset=grep {defined $_}
                            map {$subset_counter&(1<<$_)?$set[$_]:undef}
                            0..@set-1;
    	return @subset;
        }
    }

Example:

    ./ch-1a.pl 25 7
    ./ch-1a.pl 24 7

Results:

    Inputs: N=25 D=7: Output: 0
    Inputs: N=24 D=7: Output: 1 as 24=7+17

Another example:

    ./ch-1a.pl 125 7

Results:

    Inputs: N=125 D=7: Output: 1 as 125=47+78

The combinatorial method above works, but it is extremely slow.

    time (./ch-1a.pl 125 7) 2>&1

Results:

    Inputs: N=125 D=7: Output: 1 as 125=47+78

    real	0m11.182s
    user	0m11.104s
    sys	0m0.016s

I guess it could be made much faster if I discard earlier those
subsets that would fail anyway. Thus I try a recursive solution that
discards elements that are too large.

    # Task 1: Represent integer. Faster, recursive
    #
    # See https://wlmb.github.io/2021/05/22/PWC113/#task-1-represent-integer
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use v5.12;
    use List::Util qw(sum0);
    use POSIX qw(floor);

    my ($N, $D)=@ARGV; #get arguments from command line.
        die "Usage: ./ch-1.pl positive-integer digit"
        unless defined $N and defined $D and $N>=0
               and $D=~m/^\d$/ and $N==floor $N;
    my @set=reverse grep {m/$D/} (1..$N); # ordered set from large to small.
    my @answer=find($N,@set);
    say("Inputs: N=$N D=$D: Output: ",
        @answer? "1 as $N=". join("+", @answer):"0");


    sub find {
        my ($goal, @set)=@_;
        while(defined (my $current=shift @set)){
    	next if $current > $goal;
    	return ($current) if $current==$goal;
    	my @answer=find($goal-$current, @set);
    	return ($current,@answer) if @answer;
        }
        return ();
    }

Example:

    ./ch-1.pl 25 7
    ./ch-1.pl 24 7

Results:

    Inputs: N=25 D=7: Output: 0
    Inputs: N=24 D=7: Output: 1 as 24=17+7

Another example:

    time (./ch-1.pl 125 7) 2>&1

Results:

    Inputs: N=125 D=7: Output: 1 as 125=78+47

    real	0m0.014s
    user	0m0.014s
    sys	0m0.000s

Thus, I can try now much larger examples:

    time (./ch-1.pl 12345689 7) 2>&1

Results:

    Inputs: N=12345689 D=7: Output: 1 as 12345689=12345672+17

    real	0m19.920s
    user	0m18.991s
    sys	0m0.795s

Playing with the program, I realized (it should have been obvious),
that the output is 1 for all numbers larger or equal than 10\*$D. Thus,
the process could be short-circuited.

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use List::Util qw(sum0);
    use POSIX qw(floor);

    my ($N, $D)=@ARGV; #get arguments from command line.
    die "Usage: ./ch-1b.pl positive-integer digit"
        unless defined $N and defined $D and $N>=0
        and $D=~m/^\d$/ and $N==floor $N;
    say("Inputs: N=$N D=$D: Output: 1 as $N>=",$D*10), exit if $N>=$D*10;
    my @set=reverse grep {m/$D/} (1..$N); # ordered set from large to small.
    my @answer=find($N,@set);
    say("Inputs: N=$N D=$D: Output: ",
        @answer? "1 as $N=". join("+", @answer):"0");


    sub find {
        my ($goal, @set)=@_;
        while(defined (my $current=shift @set)){
    	next if $current > $goal;
    	return ($current) if $current==$goal;
    	my @answer=find($goal-$current, @set);
    	return ($current,@answer) if @answer;
        }
        return ();
    }

Examples:

    ./ch-1b.pl 25 7
    ./ch-1b.pl 24 7
    ./ch-1b.pl 125 7
    ./ch-1b.pl 12345689 7

Results:

    Inputs: N=25 D=7: Output: 0
    Inputs: N=24 D=7: Output: 1 as 24=17+7
    Inputs: N=125 D=7: Output: 1 as 125>=70
    Inputs: N=12345689 D=7: Output: 1 as 12345689>=70


# Task 2: Recreate Binary Tree

    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    You are given a Binary Tree.

    Write a script to replace each node of the tree with the sum of all
    the remaining nodes.

    Example
    Input Binary Tree
            1
           / \
          2   3
         /   / \
        4   5   6
         \
          7
    Output Binary Tree
            27
           /  \
          26  25
         /   /  \
        24  23  22
         \
         21

The sum of *all the remaining nodes* plus the given node is a
constant, *the sum of all nodes*. Thus a solution is given by
summing all nodes, recreating the original tree, and replacing each
node by its value substracted from the sum. As the tree is binary, I
may represent it as an array of the form `[value, left, right]` where
`left` and `right` are subtrees or empty arrays. This
is *ugly* but simple and unambiguous. For simplicity, I use recursion.

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use v5.12;
    use List::Util qw(sum0);

    while(my $tree_string=shift @ARGV){
        say "Input:  $tree_string";
        die "Suspicious tree $tree_string"
             unless $tree_string=~m{^[][,\-+\d\.\se]*$};
        my $tree=eval $tree_string;
        die "Bad expression: @!" if @!;
        say "Output: ",
            stringify_tree(subtract_tree($tree, sum_tree($tree)));
    }

    sub sum_tree { #sum and do some rough validation
        my $node=shift;
        die "Wrong format" unless ref($node) eq "ARRAY";
        return 0 if @$node==0;
        return $node->[0]
               +sum0 map {sum_tree($node->[$_])} (1,2) if @$node==3;
        die "Wrong format";
    }

    sub subtract_tree {
        my ($node, $from)=@_;
        return [] if @$node==0;
        return [$from-$node->[0],
                map {subtract_tree($node->[$_], $from)} (1,2)];
    }

    sub stringify_tree {
        my $node=shift;
        return "[]" if @$node==0;
        return sprintf("[%s,%s,%s]", $node->[0],
               map {stringify_tree($node->[$_])} (1,2));
    }

Example:

    ./ch-2.pl [1,[2,[4,[],[7,[],[]]],[]],[3,[5,[],[]],[6,[],[]]]]

Results:

    Input:  [1,[2,[4,[],[7,[],[]]],[]],[3,[5,[],[]],[6,[],[]]]]
    Output: [27,[26,[24,[],[21,[],[]]],[]],[25,[23,[],[]],[22,[],[]]]]
