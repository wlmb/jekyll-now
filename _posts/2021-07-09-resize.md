Before I forget, I write down the steps to resize my lvm partitions in
my Debian laptop.

If the partition to resize is not the root or boot partition I can (re)boot
into recovery mode. If it is the root or boot partition I may need to
boot a live operating system.

If I want to decrease the partition first I must decrease the file
system. Before anything, I should check the filesystem.

    umount /usr/local
    e2fsck -fy /dev/mapper/yapaque--vg-usr--local
    resize2fs /dev/mapper/yapaque--vg-usr--local 29G

Here I must make sure that the new size is large enough so that the
data fits.

Then I can reduce the partition to a size that is larger than size of
the filesystem used above

    lvreduce -L 30G /dev/yapaque-vg/usr-local

Note that the name is different, but I refer to the same partition.

Now I resize again the filesystem to take up all available space
within the partition.

    resize2fs /dev/mapper/yapaque--vg-usr--local

That's it.

If I just want to extend the filesystem and I have space in the volume
the procedure is slightly shorter. I extend the partition, check the
filesystem and extend it to fill the partition.

    umount /home
    lvextend -L +30G /dev/yapaque-vg/home
    e2fsck -fy /dev/mapper/yapaque--vg-home
    resize2fs /dev/mapper/yapaque--vg-home
