My solutions ([task 1](https://github.com/wlmb/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-115/wlmb/perl/ch-1.pl) and [task 2](https://github.com/wlmb/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-115/wlmb/perl/ch-2.pl)) to the  [The Weekly Challenge - 115](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-115).


# Task 1: String Chain

    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    You are given an array of strings.

    Write a script to find out if the given strings can be chained to form
    a circle. Print 1 if found otherwise 0.

    A string $S can be put before another string $T in circle if the last
    character of $S is same as first character of $T.

    Examples:
    Input: @S = ("abc", "dea", "cd")
    Output: 1 as we can form circle e.g. "abc", "cd", "dea".

    Input: @S = ("ade", "cbd", "fgh")
    Output: 0 as we can't form circle.

I will assume that all the strings have to participate exactly once in the
circle.

There is a nice solution to this task using matrices. I define a
connectivity matrix *C<sub>ij</sub>* which has the value 0 if string
*i* can follow string *j* and is zero otherwise. If I multiply
this matrix by a column vector *K<sub>k</sub>* which has the value 1 at position
*j=k* and the value 0 elsewhere, then I obtain a vector with a 1 at the
positions corresponding to each string that can be reached from the *k*-th
string and 0 elsewhere. If I act with *C* on the result, I would get a vector
with a 1 or a 2 at each position that may be reached by traveling two
steps from string *k*, and zero elsewhere.
The result 2 corresponds to
those strings that may be reached following two different paths, and the
result 1 to strings that can only be reached along a unique two-step
path.  Thus, the entry *ij* of the
matrix *C&times; C* is the number of paths that can start at *j* and
reach *i* in two steps. Analogously, *C&times; C&times; C\ldots*
repeated *n* times has entries *ij* showing the number of paths that
start at *j* and end at *i* after *n* steps. A problem with this
approach is that I may count paths that
return to a starting position several times. To avoid this, I have to
eliminate the diagonal elements before multiplication. Thus I define
a set of new matrices as follows: *D<sup>(1)</sup>* is *C* after setting its
diagonal elements to zero. Then I
define recursively *D<sup>(n)</sup>* as *E<sup>(n)</sup>* with its diagonal
elements set to zero, where *E<sup>(n)</sup>=D<sup>(n-1)</sup>&times; D<sup>(1)</sup>*. I can make a cycle that visits
every string if starting at any position *j*, give *N-1* steps and return to *j* without
having repeated any other site, that is, if
*E<sup>(N)</sup><sub>jj</sub>&ne; 0* for all *j*.

To manipulate the matrices I use the *Perl Data Language*.

To find out which string is connected to which other we just have to
check their first and last letters.

    # Task 1: String Chain
    #
    # See https://wlmb.github.io/2021/06/01/PWC115/#task-1-string-chain
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use v5.12;
    use List::Util qw(reduce);
    use PDL;

    my @strings=@ARGV;
    die "Usage ./ch-1.pl string1 [string2...]" unless @strings;
    my $C=zeroes(long,scalar(@strings), scalar(@strings)); #connectivity matrix
    map {my $f=$_;map {$C->slice("$f,$_").=follows($f, $_)}
        (0..@strings-1)}(0..@strings-1);
    my $R=reduce {map{$_->diagonal(0,1).=0}($a,$b); $b x $a;}
                 ($C) x @strings;
    say "Input: ", join " ", @strings;
    say "Output: ", all($R->diagonal(0,1)>0);
    sub follows {
        my ($from, $to)=map {$strings[$_]} @_;
        return substr($from,-1,1) eq substr($to,0,1);
    }

Examples:

    ./ch-1.pl abc dea cd
    ./ch-1.pl ade cbd fgh

Results:

    Input: abc dea cd
    Output: 1
    Input: ade cbd fgh
    Output: 0

as expected from the description of the task.

Two  cases with two short independent loops, inconmesurate in one
case and conmesurate in the other:

    ./ch-1.pl ab bc ca de ed
    ./ch-1.pl ab bc ca de ef fd

Results:

    Input: ab bc ca de ed
    Output: 0
    Input: ab bc ca de ef fd
    Output: 0

In the first case, at the end of five steps no string went back to
itself. In the second case, at the end of six steps all strings have
gone back to themselves twice, but as the program eliminates early
returns to the starting positions, the circle cannot be formed.

A similar case, connecting the loops:

    ./ch-1.pl ab bc ca de ed cd dc

In the case, we do have a circle `ab-bc-cd-de-ed-dc-ca-repeat`.

An example with just one string:

    ./ch-1.pl aa

Results:

    Input: aa
    Output: 1

as `aa-repeat` may be considered as a circle of length one. Note the trick
for this special case: `reduce` returns `$C` without further
processing, i.e., without zeroing the diagonal, when there is only one node.

A fringe case:

    ./ch-1.pl ab ba ab ba

Results:

    Input: ab ba ab ba
    Output: 1

as I didn't demand unique strings, so I consider, for example, the
second `ab` as
different from the first. If desired, it would be easy to filter out
repeated strings. Even if I did demand unique strings, the
topology of the example above would be equivalent to that of

    ./ch-1.pl axb bxa ayb bya

Results:

    Input: axb bxa ayb bya
    Output: 1

Notice that in this case there is more than one circle:
`axb-bxa-ayb-bya-repeat` and `axb-bya-ayb-bxa-repeat`.

The program above doesn't display the actual circle, it just states
that it exists or that it doesn't.


# Task 2: Largest Multiple

    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    You are given a list of positive integers (0-9), single digit.

    Write a script to find the largest multiple of 2 that can be formed
    from the list.

    Examples
    Input: @N = (1, 0, 2, 6)
    Output: 6210

    Input: @N = (1, 4, 2, 8)
    Output: 8412

    Input: @N = (4, 1, 7, 6)
    Output: 7614

This seems very simple. The least significant digit should be the
smallest even number, as that makes the full number even. The rest of
the digits should increase from least to most significant to get the
largest digits multiplied by the largest powers of 10. I admit repeated digits.

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use v5.12;
    use List::MoreUtils qw(first_index);
    foreach(@ARGV){
        die "Usage: ./ch-2.pl digits1 [digits2...]"
             unless m/^\d+$/;
        say "Input: $_";
        my @digits=sort {$a<=>$b} split '', $_;
        my $even_index=first_index {$_%2==0} @digits;
        say("No even number may be constructed from input"), next
             unless $even_index>=0;
        my $last=splice @digits, $even_index,1;
        say "Output: ", reverse(@digits), $last;
    }

Examples

    ./ch-2.pl 1026 1428 4176 13579

Results:

    Input: 1026
    Output: 6210
    Input: 1428
    Output: 8412
    Input: 4176
    Output: 7614
